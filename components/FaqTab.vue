        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">If we give $1,100,000, what will happen? </h5>
          <p>Suppose the people of FC meet all three goals. In that case, we will (1) renovate our Knoxville location, (2) start our counseling ministry (3) our elders will diligently pursue the acquisition of three acres adjacent to our Maryville location.</p>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">Why is each goal in its current sequential order? </h5>
          <p>Our elders believe that our most significant opportunity to make more disciples is by investing first in our Knoxville location. Research has shown that new churches grow faster, reach more people, and attract the lost quicker than existing & established churches in a community. Secondly, we know that counseling is a great need that can be met with minimal financial investment. Third, our Maryville location expansion is a significant long-term investment that will take further capital to produce its total result. </p>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">Will the $374,000 fully complete the Knoxville location? </h5>
          <p>The resources given to the Vision Offering will complete phase one of our Knoxville location. Phase one allows the facility to be "move-in-ready." The first renovation segment will construct the atrium, connect center, a 200-seat auditorium, two kids' ministry spaces, and more. Future phases of renovation will occur as the Knoxville location grows. </p>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">If we do not reach goal one, will we still renovate the Knoxville location? </h5>
          <p>Yes, within our upcoming fiscal year budget, we have accounted for payments of a loan to complete. Acquiring the note for the renovation create manageable yet uncomfortable stress on the other ministries at FC. In other words, we believe in Knoxville even if the result of the renovation is a period of uncomfortability. </p>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">Are we still building a physical counseling center? </h5>
          <p>It is our future hope to build a counseling center. Unfortunately, we do not believe this is the best use of resources right now. Instead, we will use our current Maryville location to house our new counseling ministry for the foreseeable future. </p>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">Why do we need counselors? Don't we have pastors? </h5>
          <p>Our pastoral team regularly offers biblical wisdom & counsel. But, most of them are not classically trained in biblical counseling. We believe that to serve our community best, we need to invest in trained & licensed biblical counselors to deal with the many spiritual, relational, and emotional needs. </p>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">Is the property surrounding the Maryville location on the market?</h5>
          <p>The property is not currently for sale. Our elders are diligently pursuing the purchase of the property with the current owner. We pray that God would move in the owner's heart & would be willing to give or sell us the property at a fair market value.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">Does the Maryville location expansion include the creation of a parking lot & counseling center?</h5>
          <p>The $505,000 given will be for property acquisition. Plans to create space, pave the lot, and build a facility will occur in the future as the elders see fit. </p>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">Can I give to just one specific goal? </h5>

        <div class="py-5">
          <h5 class = "uppercase font-bold text-xl">If one goal is partially met, what happens? </h5>
