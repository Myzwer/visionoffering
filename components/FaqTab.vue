				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">If we give $1,694,500, what will happen?</h5>
					<p>Suppose the people of FC meet all three goals. In that case, we will (1) bless our local and global outreach ministry partners, (2) have the funds prepared to purchase land and expand our Maryville location and (3) begin phase 2 of our Knoxville location renovation.</p>
				</div>

				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">Why is each goal in its current sequential order? </h5>
					<p>We believe that our most significant opportunity to make more disciples is by investing in our outreach ministries first. Secondly, our Maryville location expansion is a significant long-term investment that will take further capital to produce its total result. Finally, we need to expand to adjust to the growing need for additional space at our Knoxville location. </p>
				</div>

				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">Are we still building a physical counseling center? </h5>
					<p>It is our future hope to build a counseling center. Unfortunately, we do not believe this is the best use of resources right now. Instead, we will use our current Maryville location to house our counseling ministry for the foreseeable future.</p>
				</div>

				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">IS THE PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE MARYVILLE LOCATION ON THE MARKET?</h5>
					<p>The property is not currently for sale. Our elders are diligently pursuing the purchase of the property with the current owner. We pray that God would move in the owner's heart & would be willing to give or sell us the property at a fair market value.</p>
				</div>


				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">Does the Maryville location expansion include the creation
						of a parking lot & counseling center?</h5>
					<p>The $600,000 given will be for property acquisition. Plans to create space, pave the lot, and build a facility will occur in the future as the elders see fit.</p>
				</div>


				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">Can I give to just one specific goal? </h5>
					<p>All donations to the Vision Offering will be designated to our general fund to pursue all three
						of our strategic goals. </p>
				</div>


				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">If one goal is partially met, what happens? </h5>
					<p>We will determine the best use of the resources based on prayer & our financial position
						as church. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">Can I give stocks, securities, or crypto?</h5>
					<p>Yes. To learn more, visit <a href="https://foothillschurch.com/give-stocks/">foothillschurch.com/give-stocks/</a>.
