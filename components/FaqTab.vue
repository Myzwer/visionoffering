				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">WHEN DOES THE COUNSELING CENTER OPEN?</h5>
					<p>Our Counseling Ministry is currently up and running, operating out of the church building in
						Maryville, but our goal is to renovate and have the new Counseling Center open by the Fall of
						2024.</p>
				</div>

				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">WILL THE COUNSELING CENTER BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC?</h5>
					<p>Yes. We are currently working out the details to provide counseling and mentoring to the people
						of Foothills Church and the greater community.</p>

					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">WHERE EXACTLY IS THE LAND?</h5>

				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">WHY A COUNSELING CENTER?</h5>
					<p>In John 10:10 Jesus said, “The thief comes to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may
						have life and have it abundantly.” While this is a promise to followers of Jesus, some or
						perhaps many are not experiencing the abundant life Jesus promised. Something is blocking their
						ability for this promise to be a reality. We believe Biblical Counseling can help resolve the
						issues blocking God’s children from experiencing this promise. A physical Counseling Center
						allows us to make a greater impact in our community by ministering to the people in our
						community outside of our congregation.</p>

				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">WILL THIS HELP WITH PARKING ON SUNDAYS?</h5>
					<p>Yes! We plan to have around 100 new parking spaces available, and we hope to secure a vehicle to
						shuttle people from the parking lot across the street to the front door of the church.</p>
				</div>

				<hr>
				<div class="py-5">
					<h5 class="uppercase font-bold text-xl">IF THE GOAL IS PARTIALLY MET, WHAT HAPPENS?</h5>
					<p>We will determine the best use of the resources based on prayer & our financial position as a
						church.</p>
