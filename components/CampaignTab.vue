				<h3 class=" uppercase bold text-2xl pb-5">We can go further, faster together</h3>
				<p class="pb-5">The heartbeat of our vision as a church lies in the profound calling to make disciples
					and share the transformative message of Jesus Christ. As Christians, we recognize that this
					responsibility doesn't rest solely on the shoulders of a few, but rather, it's a collective duty
					that unites us as a church family. As we step into this new year, our focus remains steadfast on the
					twin pillars of blessing and expansion, two intertwined pursuits that reflect our dedication to
					fulfilling God's purpose for us. </p>

				<p class="pb-5">Below, we will explore the three primary areas where we believe God is leading us in the
					coming year. Together, we will embrace the opportunity to be willing to give over & above our
					regular commitment to fuel the vision. We want to challenge you to make a one-time gift and an
					ongoing commitment to the Vision Offering so that you can continue to invest in the vision of
					Foothills Church!</p>

				<p class="pb-5">Here are three steps we want to resource & take in 2024:</p>

				<h3 class=" uppercase bold text-2xl pt-10 font-bold">Goal 1 - Header Image: Focus On The Theme “bless”
					($50,000)</h3>
				<p class="pt-5">Together, we will Financially Bless a variety of local and global
					ministries that have had a huge impact on the mission of God. We always strive to be a generous
					church that provides resources to faithful ministries. Our goal is to continue that generosity by
					giving to the Cooperative Program, which is a ministry of over 50,000 Baptist churches that
					cooperate in planting churches overseas, training pastors in seminaries, planting churches in the
					largest cities in America, and providing Disaster Relief when tragedies occur. </p>

				<h4 class="capitalize text-xl pt-10 font-bold">Global Outreach</h4>
				<p class="pt-2">We want to continue to send our own partners to Africa to serve the people
					of Zambia this year. Additionally, we want to continue to support Vapor Ministries, an organization
					serving the poorest communities in the world in both Haiti and Africa. </p>

				<h4 class=" capitalize text-xl pt-10 font-bold">Local Outreach</h4>
				<p class="pt-2">We want to continue to support a variety of local organizations like the
					Pregnancy Resource Center, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Hope Resources Center, our Orphan Care
					Ministries, and Sex Trafficking organizations.</p>

				<h3 class=" uppercase bold text-2xl pt-10 font-bold">Goal 2 - Header Image: Focus On The Theme “expand”
					($600,000)</h3>
				<h4 class="capitalize text-xl pt-10 font-bold">Together we can expand</h4>
				<p class="pt-5">Our primary need at our Maryville Location is space for parking. We consistently fill
					our parking lot, which makes it difficult to have space to welcome guests to FC. </p>
				<p class="pt-5">We are so thankful that every week, hundreds of people park in our overflow lots next
					door in order to open up spaces for the new people God is bringing to our church. We believe the
					cost would be at least $600,000 to acquire land for additional parking in Maryville.</p>
				<p class="pt-5">More land will provide parking, but it could also allow us to meet a huge need in our
					community for our counseling ministry. Hundreds of counseling sessions happen at FC every month, and
					we dream of one day being able to build a physical counseling center, which is a future goal that we
					are asking God to provide. </p>
				<p class="pt-5">At this point, God hasn’t revealed the opportunity to buy land, but we believe God will
					answer in His timing.</p>

			<h3 class="uppercase bold text-2xl pt-10 font-bold">Goal 3 - Header Image: Focus On The Theme “expand”
				($1,000,000)</h3>
			<h4 class="capitalize text-xl pt-10 font-bold">One Church in two locations</h4>
			<p class="pt-5">We started our Knoxville location 2 years ago, and in this last year, we renovated a movie
				theater in Knoxville to be the new home for our Knoxville Location. We’re experiencing record numbers of
				baptisms, attendance, and first-time guests every week.</p>
			<p class="pt-5">Our first Phase of the renovation gave us the ability to move in and use the space, but we
				are far from finished. In order to further expand, we need to take the next step for our Knoxville
				Location by renovating the space for an auditorium and suitable kids' spaces to meet the needs of a
				growing church. We believe the cost of this project would be $1,000,000.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-span-12">
			<p class=" pt-5 pb-3">With all three combined the total goal is $1,694,500 million. This may sound like an
				extraordinary number to you, but God is not intimidated by that number. And neither should we. God can
				provide, but each of us will have to step out in faith and give.</p>

			<p class=" pt-5 pb-3">We want to encourage you to pray and give toward our Vision Offering. This offering is
				a one-time gift and an ongoing commitment to give in 2024.</p>

			<p class=" pt-5 pb-3">Together, we can do this! But it will take prayer, faith, and sacrifice. Let’s give to
				the vision offering & let's watch God work.
