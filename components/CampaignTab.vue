				<p class="pb-5">We are so blessed with the new, exciting opportunity to purchase the land right across
					the street from our Maryville location to serve as the home of our new Counseling Center and provide
					us with around one hundred new parking spots.</p>

				<p class="pb-5">This has been a dream of ours and a goal that we have been praying for and asking God to
					provide. Originally, the second goal of our vision offering was to raise $600,000 in order to have
					what we believed to be the necessary funds to purchase land. But, with this new opportunity across
					the street, we now know that the total cost will be around $1.2 million to secure the land,
					transform the land into additional parking, and make the necessary renovations to turn the existing
					building into a fitting home for counseling sessions to take place.</p>

				<p class="pb-5">This opportunity is truly an answer to prayer, but we need your help to make it happen.
					We encourage you to join us in praying over our counseling ministry, this new opportunity, and for
					how you can make a difference by making a financial gift to help fuel our vision.</p>
