        <p class="pb-5">Every significant moment begins with one small step! Whether it be mankind, a nation, a
          community, or a
          family, to do great things, each must decide to take their next step. We, as a church, must choose too. Will
          we take our next step?</p>

        <p class="pb-5">We believe God has given Christians a mission to make disciples. It is our job as believers in
          East Tennesee
          to carry this out in our specific community. As we look towards 2023, we see three primary areas we believe
          God is calling us to pursue. But to do this, we must be willing to give over & above our regular commitment to
          fuel the vision.</p>

        <p class="pb-5">We want to challenge you to make a one-time gift to the Vision Offering by November 20 so that
          you can be a part of
          your church's significant next step!</p>

        <p class="pb-5">Here are three steps we want to resource & take in 2023:</p>

        <h3 class=" uppercase bold text-2xl pt-10 font-bold">Goal 1 - Knoxville Location Renovation ($374,000)</h3>
        <p class="text-xl pt-5 mb-10">In 2022 Foothills Church secured a lease of a permanent space for our Knoxville
          location
          at the former Dollar Movie Theater in Knoxville. The area is 22,860 sq ft with ample parking & room for
          growth. The challenge is that we know we must turn a theater into a church. Your one-time gift by November 20
          to the vision offering will create a space for kids, students, and adults to worship Jesus & experience life
          change. By giving to the vision offering, you will be part of developing mature disciples of Christ in the
          Knoxville community. </p>

        <p class="text-xl pt-5 pb-10">Did you know Blount County has only 11 counseling centers for 131,000+ people? Not
          to
          mention, only one of them classifies as biblical counseling! Our church has dreamed of starting a counseling
          center to address the many spiritual & relational needs in our community for years. But to do that, it will
          take approximately $225,000 to hire staff, acquire training, and address the many logistical challenges of a
          ministry like this. We pray that 2023 is the year the dream becomes a reality. Your one-time gift by November
          20 to the vision offering can help start a new counseling center for the community. </p>

      <h3 class=" uppercase bold text-2xl pt-10 font-bold">Goal 3 - Maryville Location Expansion ($505,000)</h3>
      <p class="text-xl pt-5">God has blessed & grown our Maryville location. But unfortunately, we are out of parking!
        Every Sunday, we park almost 100-150 cars off-site to create space for guests to attend our church. The bad news
        is that the lot is still full even as we park off-site. The good news is that there is plenty of acreage around
        our facility to accommodate growth. As we have diligently pursued the surrounding property, our elders believe
        in purchasing three acres; we will need an additional $505,000. Your one-time gift by November 20 will fuel the
        expansion of our Maryville location. </p>

        the next step toward making disciples in our communities! </p>
