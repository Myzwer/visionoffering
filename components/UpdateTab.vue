          <p class="py-3">We believe that God is calling each of us to take our next step here at Foothills Church. Our
            Vision Offering is a unique opportunity to answer God's call. The Vision Offering is an opportunity to give
            a one-time gift over and above our regular contributions to fuel God's vision. This year, we have three
            goals that we want to encourage you to pray for and give toward. </p>

          <p class="py-3">First, we hope to raise <span class="font-bold">$374,000</span> to
            renovate the new home of our Knoxville location. God provided the space, but we now need to turn a movie
            theater into a church. Second, we have a dream to start a counseling center to address the many spiritual
            and relational needs in our community. </p>
          <p class="py-3">We believe that if we can raise <span class="font-bold">$225,000</span>, we can take our next
            step
            to hire staff, purchase resources, and address the many start-up cost required with a new ministry. </p>

          <p class="py-3">Finally, we are diligently pursuing property surrounding our Maryville location to provide
            space for more parking. We
            believe we need to raise <span class="font-bold">$505,000</span> in order to do this. With all three of
            these goals, the total monetary
            goal is $1,100,000. That may sound like an extraordinary number to you, but God is not intimidated by that
            number. </p>

          <p class="py-3"><span class = "font-bold">We can do this!</span> But it will take faith, sacrifice, and commitment to take our next step. Letâ€™s give
            to the Vision Offering by November 20th and see what God will do. You can prayerfully check back on this
            page for updates on our goals and to see how God is using our generosity to fuel the vision.</p>
