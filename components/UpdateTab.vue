					<p class="py-3">We have challenged everyone who calls Foothills Church home to consider giving a
						one-time gift over and above our regular contributions to fuel three strategic goals for 2023.
						Our church has stepped up in a truly incredible way! We are excited to have <span
							class="font-bold">completed our first
							goal of $370,000</span> for our Knoxville Location Renovation!</p>

					<p class="py-3">Now our focus shifts to our Counseling Ministry Start-Up. We know that there are
						still many who haven’t given yet. Maybe you have felt compelled to give and have yet to take
						that step, or maybe this morning, you feel like God is calling you to support the vision. We
						want to encourage you to pray about supporting the vision. </p>

					<p class="py-3">You can give one of three ways, you can give in person at one of our physical giving
						stations at your location, you can give here online, or you can even give a tax-exempt transfer
						stock.</p>

					<p class="py-3">We can do this! But it will take faith, sacrifice, and commitment to take our next
						step. Let’s give to the Vision Offering and see what God will do. You can continue to check back
						on this site to see how God is using our generosity to fuel the vision. </p>

					<p class="py-3">We believe that God is calling each of us to take our next step here at Foothills
						Church. Our
						Vision Offering is a unique opportunity to answer God's call. The Vision Offering is an
						opportunity to give
						a one-time gift over and above our regular contributions to fuel God's vision. This year, we
						have three
						goals that we want to encourage you to pray for and give toward. </p>

					<p class="py-3">First, we hope to raise <span class="font-bold">$374,000</span> to
						renovate the new home of our Knoxville location. God provided the space, but we now need to turn
						a movie
						theater into a church. Second, we have a dream to start a counseling center to address the many
						spiritual
						and relational needs in our community. </p>
					<p class="py-3">We believe that if we can raise <span class="font-bold">$225,000</span>, we can take
						our next
						step
						to hire staff, purchase resources, and address the many start-up cost required with a new
						ministry. </p>

					<p class="py-3">Finally, we are diligently pursuing property surrounding our Maryville location to
						provide
						space for more parking. We
						believe we need to raise <span class="font-bold">$505,000</span> in order to do this. With all
						three of
						these goals, the total monetary
						goal is $1,100,000. That may sound like an extraordinary number to you, but God is not
						intimidated by that
						number. </p>

					<p class="py-3"><span class="font-bold">We can do this!</span> But it will take faith, sacrifice,
						and commitment to take our next step. Let’s give
						to the Vision Offering by November 20th and see what God will do. You can prayerfully check back
						on this
						page for updates on our goals and to see how God is using our generosity to fuel the vision.</p>
